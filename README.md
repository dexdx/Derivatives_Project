# Reverse convertible notes pricing

The programming part of this project was concerned with writing a code that takes as input the parameters of a binomial model and the characteristics of the reverse convertible note (RCN) and which outputs the arbitrage price of the RCN at the initial date of the tree as well as the initial portfolio of the index and the riskless asset that the issuer should hold to replicate the note.
